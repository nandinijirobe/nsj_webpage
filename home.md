# About Me
I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), currently serving as Vice President of the Graduate Society of Women Engineers, and a research volunteer in UIC’s NLP Lab on a project focused on nonverbal behavior generation in robots. <br><br>
I enjoy gaining new experiences and learning new technologies to develop a broad understanding of the tech field. In the past, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, presenting my findings at the National Early Research Scholars Conference. I’ve also worked on machine learning projects with Allstate and the New York Botanical Garden, developing models for predicting wildfire risks and building plant specimen classifiers. My experience spans Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Development. I’ve also TA’d Advanced Data Structures and Python classes, and completed tech internships with AbbVie and UI Health.
